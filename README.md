Python setup:

Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed on your computer (certain libraries do NOT support higher versions)

You can verify this if "python3.12" is a valid command

To set up the virtual environment, type 
```python3.12 -m venv env```

You must then activate the virtual environment:

Windows: ```env\Scripts\activate.bat```

Mac/Linux: ```source env/bin/activate```

Lastly, install the dependencies in the virtual environment: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
